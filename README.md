# Client-side Pagination in React (Next.js 15)

This tutorial demonstrates how to implement simple client-side pagination using `useState` in a **Next.js 15** project. Itâ€™s a clean, lightweight example for beginners who want to learn how to paginate a list of data without relying on external libraries or backend logic.

## What This Project Covers

- Splitting a static array of data into pages
- Navigating between pages with Next and Prev buttons
- Jumping to a specific page using an input field
- Disabling buttons when at the first or last page
- Calculating pagination state from array length

## Preview

The list includes 24 fruit names and displays 4 items per page. As users navigate, the view updates to show the appropriate slice of the list.
